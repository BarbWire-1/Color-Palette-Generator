  # Color Palette Generator  




  ## Description

  This is a color Palette Generator . It started as a proof of concept to use CSS variables only for calculating colors. The h, s, l can be changed with a range input. Five colors get created by setting the steps to the next hue in degree (rotation). Rightclick on one of the color-buttons saves the hex code to the clipboard. 
  
  Finally the created palette can be saved as an html-file including all the colorblocks and a textfield with corresponding rgb, hex and hsl-code.

  ## Installation

  As it's a little standalone just play with it. Open a running app on netlify by clicking this button:

  ## Usage

Use the sliders to see how changing one of h,s,l changes the palette. It helped me a lot to understand mathemacial correlations in colors - which I very long just refused to "understand".
... and have fun!
